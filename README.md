HydrusDBSetup/HydrusDBIO/HydrusExecuter

These are simple C++ packages that help to assess groundwater recharge in an area. These packages use tclap and Qt to parse command line arguments and connect to the database. HydrusDBSetup is used to build the database. HydrusDBIO is used to import/export the input parameter files / hydrus output result files into/from the database. HydrusExecuter is used to execute hydrus in parallel.
